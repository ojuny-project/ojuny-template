# 01 - Architecture

This document defines the repo layout, naming and numbering rules, the
dendritic module shape, and how a file maps to a settings-menu page. See
`02-settings-menu.md` for the page list itself.

## 1. Dendritic pattern

Same as dendrite: flake-parts plus import-tree.

`flake.nix` collects every `.nix` file under `modules/` (recursively, skipping
`flake.nix`, files whose name starts with `_`, and hidden directories) and
treats each as a flake-parts module. A page file therefore is a flake-parts
module that declares one or more of:

- `flake.modules.nixos.<page>`
- `flake.modules.homeManager.<page>`

A host configuration (`flake.nixosConfigurations.<host>`) imports the pages it
wants via `self.modules.nixos.<page>`. Because the nix-settings-gui follows the
import graph for its "current system only" mode, the host's imports are what
decide which menus are shown for that host.

## 2. Page file shape

Each page file has a `@menu` header and one or more inner modules. The `@menu`
comment sits before the first `flake.modules.*` assignment. `@option` comments
sit inside the inner module, directly above the assignment they describe.

```nix
{ self, inputs, ... }:
{
  /* @menu
     displayname = "Bluetooth";
     icon = "bluetooth-symbolic";
     order = 40;
     description = "Bluetooth devices and power";
     category = "07-System";
  */
  flake.modules.nixos.system-bluetooth = { config, pkgs, ... }: {
    /* @option widget = "switch"; label = "Enable Bluetooth"; */
    hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;

    /* @option widget = "switch"; label = "Power on at boot";
       group = "Devices"; */
    hardware.bluetooth.powerOnBoot = true;
  };
}
```

A page that also needs home-manager settings declares a second module in the
same file:

```nix
  flake.modules.homeManager.system-bluetooth-hm = { ... }: {
    /* @option ... */
    home.packages = [ ... ];
  };
```

Both modules live in one file so the page stays self-contained.

## 3. Shared settings and namespaces

- `desktop.ojuny.*` comes from ojuny-desktop and is consumed by the Desktop
  pages (mango, Dux Modular Shell) without local renaming. The naming is deliberately
  split three ways: the product is Dux Modular Shell, every upstream runtime
  identifier stays `dms` (the `dms` binary, `~/.config/dms`,
  `~/.local/state/dms`, `dms ipc call ...`, `dms.service`), and the option
  namespace is `desktop.ojuny.dux.*`, with a one-release alias for
  `desktop.ojuny.dms.*`. The CLI surface is `ojuny dux ...`; `ojuny dms` is a
  deprecated alias.
- Template-local options (for values used across pages, e.g. the user name,
  hostname, enabled-app toggles) are declared under a top-level `ojuny.*`
  namespace (D3a). A page may instead annotate the real NixOS or home-manager
  option directly; this is preferred when the value is used only on that page.

## 4. Layout and numbering

```
ojuny-template/
  flake.nix                 dendritic entrypoint (import-tree ./modules)
  flake.lock
  docs/                     this spec
  modules/
    01-users/
    02-core/
    03-desktop/
    04-gui/
    05-applications/
    06-utility/
    07-system/
    backend/                  backend modules and their assets
  templates/                nix-settings-gui "Add file" scaffolds (_-prefixed)
  scripts/                  setup script + helpers
  packages/                 any local packages
```

Rules:

- Category folders are numbered `01-`, `02-`, ... to order the repository
  tree; page files are numbered within their folder.
- The GUI does not read folder or file names. It sorts menus by the `@menu`
  `category` string, then by `@menu order`, then by `displayname`.
- `@menu category` is an explicit string carrying its own sort prefix (for
  example `"07-System"`); the GUI prints it verbatim as the section heading.
  Because sorting is ASCII, prefixes `01-` ... `07-` precede unprefixed names
  such as `Patches`.
- `@menu order` is the page's position within its category (for example `40`),
  independent of the file number.

The numbering currently applied is generated from the directory itself rather
than maintained here. [`module-tree.md`](module-tree.md) lists every file under
`modules/`, grouped by top-level directory and sorted; `scripts/gen-module-tree.sh`
regenerates it and CI fails when the checked-in file differs. See
`02-settings-menu.md` for what the categories and page files mean.

Files marked `[no menu]` in 02 carry no `@menu` header and are skipped by the
scanner: `03-desktop/00-mango.nix`, the generated `system-hardware` module and
the generated `system-hardware-quirks` module.

## 5. Generated and templated files

The setup script (see `03-host-setup.md`) writes machine-specific files. These
are the only tracked files that may contain personal data, and they are
generated or templated, not hand-written. Tools find them by flake module name,
not by path; see `12-flake-module-contract.md`.

- The `system-hardware` and `system-bootloader` modules and `facter.json`:
  generated by the script from the host's detected hardware and a
  `nixos-facter` report. The hardware module carries no `@menu` header
  (D5, D6a).
- The `system-hardware-quirks` module: generated by `regenerate-hardware` and
  imports one `nixos-hardware` profile, or imports nothing when the machine is
  unmatched. It carries no `@menu` header.
- The `users` module: templated and filled by the script, shipped with a
  neutral `user` account. The Users widget manages `users.users` and, with
  `homeManager = true`, the sibling `home-manager.users` block (D13, D17).
- The canonical fallback paths are `modules/00-hardware.nix`,
  `modules/facter.json`, `modules/backend/00-hardware-quirks.nix`,
  `modules/00-user.nix`, `modules/00-configuration.nix` and
  `modules/00-host.nix`. A fork may keep its own paths when the module exists.

## 6. Flake outputs

- `nixosConfigurations.<host>` for each host (initially one host generated by
  the setup script).
- `nixosModules.default`, `homeManagerModules.default` re-exported from
  ojuny-desktop (so the template can also be consumed as a module).
- `packages.*` for any local packages.

## 7. Relation to other repos

- **ojuny-desktop** is an input; it supplies mangoWM, Dux Modular Shell, and the
  `desktop.ojuny.dux.*` options plus the wrapped session package.
- **nix-settings-gui** is an input; enabling it installs the GUI
  (`services.nix-settings-gui.enable`) and it renders one menu per page file.
- **ojuny-welcome** is an input; enabling it installs the first-boot wizard
  (`services.ojuny-welcome.enable`). The installer carries the package but
  leaves the service disabled on the live ISO.
- **nix-shell-gui** is an input (`services.nix-shell-gui.enable`) and
  **nix-regedit** is an input (`services.nix-regedit.enable`); both are placed
  in `02-core/11-nixsettings.nix`.
- **simple-nix-update-gui** is an input
  (`services.simple-nix-update-gui.*`), placed in `02-core/10-updates.nix`
  together with nix-settings-gui.
- **nixos-hardware** is an input. `backend/10-hardware-profile.nix` maps the
  facter report to one profile, including a GPU variant when `gpuProfiles`
  declares one, and the generated `system-hardware-quirks` module imports it.
  The profile dropdown and the GPU ownership flags live on
  `07-system/09-facter.nix`. `07-system/04-graphics.nix` resolves the `auto`
  target from those flags and stops emitting the GPU definitions the profile
  owns.

## 8. Resolved decisions

- D3a template options under top-level `ojuny.*`.
- D5 no `@menu` header means the file is not a menu; unannotated values are
  never shown.
- D6a generated/templated files live under `modules/`; `hardware.nix` is not a
  menu.
- D7a one file declares the nixos and/or home-manager module it needs.
- D13a system-specific settings in the system directory, per-user settings in
  that user's `user.nix`; all system files templated except generated
  `hardware.nix`.
- T1 the template includes nix-settings-gui, ojuny-welcome, nix-regedit,
  nix-shell-gui, and simple-nix-update-gui; dendrite-menu is dropped.
- T2 nix-shell-gui and nix-regedit in `02-core/11-nixsettings.nix`;
  nix-settings-gui and simple-nix-update-gui in `02-core/10-updates.nix`.

Open: none.
